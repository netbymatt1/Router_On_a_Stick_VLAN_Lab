# Router-On-a-Stick VLAN Lab

This lab demonstrates how to enable inter-VLAN communication using a single physical router interface with subinterfaces (Router-on-a-Stick method).

---

### Topology Summary
- **VLANs:**  
  - VLAN 10 → 192.168.10.0/24  
  - VLAN 20 → 192.168.20.0/24

- **Router:**  
  - `Gi0/0.10` → 192.168.10.1  
  - `Gi0/0.20` → 192.168.20.1  
  - Encapsulation: dot1Q

- **Switch (SW1):**  
  - Trunk port to router: `Fa0/3`  
  - Access ports:  
    - PC0 on `Fa0/2` (VLAN 10)  
    - PC1 on `Fa0/1` (VLAN 20)

---

### Objectives
- Configure inter-VLAN routing via subinterfaces on a single router port.
- Test connectivity between devices in different VLANs.

---

### Verification
From PC0:
ping 192.168.20.10
From PC1:
ping 192.168.10.10
Expected Result: Successful ping in both directions.

Status
✅ Lab tested and working successfully.
